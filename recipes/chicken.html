    This recipe is my own take on chicken fajitas, and can easily be made to feed a family,
    or leave enough for leftovers. Instead of corn, this recipe uses flour tortillas since 
    they are less likely to tear apart when actually making the fajita. Be careful when cooking
    chicken! If improperly cooked or undercooked, it may lead to food poisoning. Always cook chicken 
    to at least 165 F or about 74 Celcius.
