    These meatballs can be quickly formed, and baked for an easy dinner. 
    While I used turkey, any ground meat can easily be subsituted. This 
    recipe doesn't use breadcrumbs like most meatball recipes do,
    however, the inclusion of an egg is necessary to prevent the 
    meatballs from falling apart while they bake.
