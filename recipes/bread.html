<body><h4>Boring life story for how I made this recipe...</h4>
    Aside from the addition of protein powder and usage of greek yogurt,
    this recipe is made to imitate a typical yeast bread recipe. However, 
    the addition of these 2 ingredients can lead to a dense bread, making
    it vital to allow the bread to proof to counteract this. I make this bread
    to serve as a filling snack to help fulfill my daily protein needs
    when exercising.

            <body>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Scoop of Protein Powder of choice</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoon Yeast</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of Water</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup of Greek Yogurt</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 cup of Bread Flour</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of Milk, warm</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of Salt</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons of Cinnamon</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, add the milk and yeast then stir. Afterwards, let the mixture sit for ~10 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Once the yeast had bloomed, add the rest of the liquid ingredients and set aside</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, add the dry ingredients together
                        and whisk to remove any clumps. Afterwards, add to the liquid mixture and incorporate everything </li>
                    <li>Once everything has been mixed, knead the bread on a floured surface until the dough is stretchy and holds
                        it's form</li>
                    <li>After kneading, let the dough sit and proof for at least 1 hour, or up to 2 hours. This lets the bread dough
                        rise in volume as the gases expand from the yeast activation.</li>
                    <li>20 minutes before you bread is done proofing, preheat an oven to 350 F, and afterwards, cook for 12 to 15
                        minutes.</li>
                    <li>Let the bread set for up to an hour before cutting into it. The bread might be done on the outside, but
                        still needs a few outside of the oven to ensure the inside if fully cooked.</li>
                    <li>Once the bread has cooled down, enjoy!</li>
